## What's in the folder

* This folder contains all of the files necessary for the extension.
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file that defines the location of the snippet file and specifies the language of the snippets.
* `snippets/kod.code-snippets.json` - the file containing all snippets.
* `syntaxes/kod.tmlLanguage.json` - the file containing syntax highlighting.

## Get up and running straight away

* Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* Create a new file with a file name suffix matching your language.
* Verify that your snippets are proposed on intellisense.

## Install

* To start using the extension with Visual Studio Code copy it into the `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart Code.
